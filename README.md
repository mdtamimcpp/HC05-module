## HC-05 module Information

* This module works at 3.3V. We can connect to 5V supply voltage because the module has 5 to 3.3 V regulator.
* As HC-05 Bluetooth module has a 3.3V level for RX/TX and the microcontroller can detect the 3.3 V level, there is no need to change the transmit level of the HC-05 module. But we need to transfer transmit voltage level from microcontroller to RX of HC-05 module.
* The data transfer rate of HC-05 module can vary up to 1Mbps within 10 meters.
* Automatic connection to the last device: `Yes`
* Internal antenna: `Yes`

## For this project we need these materials

* 1X Arduino Uno R3;
* 1X Bluetooth HC-05 module;
* 1X BC547 Transistor;
* 1X DC Relay (9V);
* 1X 9V Battery;
* [Android App](https://github.com/thisistamim/HC05-apk) interfacing with HC-05;<!-- if need the apk, plz contact -->
* Extra (switch, wires, soldering iron, AC load etc.)
